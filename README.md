Description:
I'm creating a simple console application that helps users organize a playlist of concert pieces. The user can add, remove, and view pieces in the playlist. Each piece can have details such as the title, composer, and duration.

Basic Features I'm Working on Implementing:

Add a Piece: Allow the user to input the title, composer, and duration of a piece.
View Playlist: Display the list of pieces added so far.
Remove a Piece: Allow the user to remove a piece by its title or index.

The program uses an ArrayList to store Piece objects, which represent the pieces in the playlist.

The Piece class encapsulates the details of each piece, including the title, composer, and duration.

The ConcertPlaylistOrganizer class contains the main method, which includes a simple menu-driven interface for adding, viewing, and removing pieces from the playlist.

Additional features like editing entries, searching, or more detailed data (like year composed) could be added later.
