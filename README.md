Description:
I'm creating a simple console application that helps users organize a playlist of concert pieces. The user can add, remove, and view pieces in the playlist. Each piece can have details such as the title, composer, and duration.

Basic Features I'm Working on Implementing:

Add a Piece: Allow the user to input the title, composer, and duration of a piece.
View Playlist: Display the list of pieces added so far.
Remove a Piece: Allow the user to remove a piece by its title or index.

Additional features like editing entries, searching, or more detailed data (like year composed) could be added later.
